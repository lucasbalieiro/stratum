//! # Decoder
//!
//! Provides utilities for decoding messages held by Sv2 frames, with or without Noise protocol
//! support.
//!
//! It includes primitives to both decode encoded standard Sv2 frames and to decrypt and decode
//! Noise-encrypted encoded Sv2 frames, ensuring secure communication when required.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! All messages passed between Sv2 roles are encoded as Sv2 frames. These frames are decoded using
//! primitives in this module. There are two types of decoders for reading these frames: one for
//! regular Sv2 frames [`Decoder`], and another for Noise-encrypted frames `NoiseDecoder` (under
//! the `noise_sv2` feature). Both decoders manage the deserialization of incoming data and, when
//! applicable, the decryption of the data upon receiving the transmitted message.
//!
//! ### Buffer Management
//!
//! The decoders rely on buffers to hold intermediate data during the decoding process.
//!
//! - When the `with_buffer_pool` feature is enabled, the internal `Buffer` type is backed by a
//!   pool-allocated buffer [`buffer_sv2::BufferPool`], providing more efficient memory usage,
//!   particularly in high-throughput scenarios.
//! - If this feature is not enabled, a system memory buffer [`buffer_sv2::BufferFromSystemMemory`]
//!   is used for simpler applications where memory efficiency is less critical.
